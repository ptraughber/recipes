Berry jam
Ingredients
- 1 pound berries
- 1/2 cup sugar 
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
- pinch of salt

Instructions
1. Remove any berry stems and slice them in half 
2. Combine berries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt into a pot
3. Put pot over medium heat with no lid
4. Cook with no lid for approximately 30 to 60 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning, and use a whisk or potato masher to crush berries.
5. The jam is done when the jam is thick, and if you put a drop of jam on a spoon which has been in the freezer, the jam should firm up on the frozen spoon. Wipe the jam on the spoon and if it doesn't spill back onto itself, it's ready.
